This prototype is to test the battle system, basic and replayable. There are three allies and three types of enemies as well as a boss. The allied characters may have different levels, which each grants different stats values, and some unlock a special attack. The enemies doesnâ€™t have levels, their stats are predetermined.

From the menu, you will be able to choose which kind of enemies you want in the field with a maximum of three, including the boss, too. Also, you will be able to choose at which level your allied characters will be.
Then, you have to choose the play mode: Player vs Machine or Machine vs Machine.

During the game, all the characters in the field are sorted per attack speed to decide the turns, this means that the faster fighters will have the turn before the slower ones. In any of the cases, for each character, a random action to perform (among the available ones) will be decided by the bot that controls it (the player, of course, can decide the action for its characters and their objectives).

You can check out the different roles of the characters, their stats and special attacks or actions in [this excel](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1I1iKXhe45bplV0mD5tZX8ZDLUZim8eIw5SiCXSxrVEg/edit?usp=sharing).
